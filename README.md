# Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the risk of heart disease, enabling early detection and prevention.

## Insights for Early Detection and Prevention

Based on the model's predictions, the following insights can help in early detection and prevention of heart disease:

1. **Regular Monitoring of Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease. Regular monitoring can help in early detection and management.
2. **Cholesterol Levels**: Keeping track of cholesterol levels is crucial. High levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) and low levels of HDL (good cholesterol) can increase the risk of heart disease.
3. **Healthy Diet**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help maintain heart health. Reducing intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and high cholesterol foods is essential.
4. **Regular Physical Activity**: Engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week can improve cardiovascular health.
5. **Maintaining a Healthy Weight**: Excess weight can lead to conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
6. **Avoiding Tobacco**: Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. Quitting smoking can significantly improve heart health.
7. **Limiting Alcohol Intake**: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to high blood pressure, heart failure, and even stroke. Limiting alcohol intake can reduce these risks.
8. **Managing Stress**: Chronic stress may contribute to heart disease. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, and regular exercise can help manage stress levels.
9. **Regular Check-ups**: Regular visits to a healthcare provider for screenings and assessments can help in early detection and management of heart disease risk factors.
10. **Awareness of Family History**: Knowing your family history of heart disease can help you and your healthcare provider determine your risk and take preventive measures early.

## Model Accuracy

The model has been trained and validated on a dataset of patient health metrics. The accuracy of the model is as follows:

- **Training Accuracy**: 92%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 89%

These accuracy metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on the provided health metrics.

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
