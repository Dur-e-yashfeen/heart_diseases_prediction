# Heart Disease Prediction Report 🏥💖

## 1. Introduction 📢
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide 🌍💔. Early detection plays a vital role in preventing severe complications. In this report, we explore how machine learning models can predict heart disease based on patient health data.

## 2. Objectives 🎯
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze patient data and identify key risk factors 🩸.
- To preprocess and visualize the dataset for better insights 📊.
- To develop a machine learning model that predicts heart disease with high accuracy 🤖.
- To evaluate the model's performance using various metrics ✅.

## 3. Dataset Description 📂
The dataset used contains various features related to patient health conditions, including:
- **Age** – Patient’s age 👵👨.
- **Sex** – Gender of the patient 🚹🚺.
- **Chest Pain Type** – Different types of chest pain experienced 💢.
- **Blood Pressure** – Resting blood pressure levels 🩸.
- **Cholesterol** – Serum cholesterol levels 🍔.
- **Blood Sugar Levels** – Fasting blood sugar readings 🍭.
- **ECG Results** – Electrocardiographic results ⚡.
- **Heart Rate** – Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise 🏃.
- **Exercise-Induced Angina** – Pain occurrence during exercise 🚴.
- **ST Depression** – A key ECG feature for heart disease detection 📉.
- **Heart Disease Presence** – Target variable indicating disease presence ❤️.

## 4. Data Preprocessing 🛠️
Before training the model, the data underwent several preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values 🔄.
- Encoding categorical variables 🎭.
- Normalizing numerical data 📏.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets 🧪.

## 5. Data Visualization 📊
Visualization helped in understanding trends and distributions:
- Distribution of heart disease cases.
- Correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships 🔥.
- Bar plots and histograms to visualize key patterns 📈.

## 6. Model Development 🤖
A Random Forest Classifier was trained to predict heart disease. The steps included:
- Splitting data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets 🧩.
- Training the model using decision trees 🌳.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization 🔄.

## 7. Model Evaluation ✅
The model’s performance was assessed using:
- **Accuracy Score** – Measures overall correctness 📊.
- **Confusion Matrix** – Evaluates prediction distribution 🔄.
- **Classification Report** – Provides precision, recall, and F1-score 📑.

### Results:
- Model Accuracy: **85%** 📈.
- High precision and recall in predicting heart disease cases.
- Random Forest performed well with balanced predictions.

## 8. Conclusion 🎯
Machine learning proves to be an effective tool for predicting heart disease based on patient data. By implementing such models in healthcare systems, early detection and prevention strategies can be improved, ultimately saving lives 🚑.

## 9. Future Scope 🚀
